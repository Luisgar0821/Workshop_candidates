## 🚀 Running the Project

### 📥 Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luisgar0821/Workshop_candidates
```

### 🖥️ Opening in Visual Studio Code

Open the cloned repository in **Visual Studio Code**. We recommend selecting the **mi_env kernel** before running the project.

### 🔧 MySQL Configuration

💡 **Recommendation:** Install **XAMPP** since its default credentials allow us to configure only the port in the `config.txt` file if necessary.

1️⃣ Start **MySQL** from **XAMPP** to begin working, ensuring it runs on port **3306**.

2️⃣ If it's not on port **3306**, update the port in `config.txt`.
3️⃣ If using another MySQL tool (e.g., **MySQL Workbench**), start the server and update the credentials in `config.txt` accordingly.

### ▶️ Running the Notebook

Finally, simply execute the notebook **cell by cell**. The notebook will handle the **creation of the database and tables** as well as the **ingestion of relevant data**. 🚀📊
